title: Illinois CS Proficiency Exams

<p class="lead" markdown="1">
<!--- -->
If you have already mastered the material covered in certain Illinois Computer Science
courses, you may receive credit and satisfy prerequisites by taking a
*proficiency exam*.
<!--- -->
Here you will find details about how to prepare and sign up for Illinois CS
proficiency exams.
<!--- -->
</p>

## <a name="overview" class="anchor"></a> Overview

Proficiency exams are similar in coverage and scope to a comprehensive
final exam.
<!--- -->
They are intended to ensure that you are well-prepared for later courses in the
same subject area.
<!--- -->
**Passing criteria are at the discretion of each course instructor.**
<!---
But in general an exam score that would correspond to a course grade of a B- is
considered a passing score.
-->

### <a name="scheduling" class="anchor"></a> Scheduling

Written proficiency exams are offered two times each fall and spring semester:

* the **1st** week,
<!--- -->
* and in the **9th** week (immediately following the drop deadline).

Courses that give computer-based proficiency exams in the [Computer-Based
Testing Facility (CBTF)](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/) generally offer their exams
during a window of time around the same time as the written exams are offered,
but may also offer exams at other times.
<!--- -->
Please consult the [course-specific information](#courses) below to determine
whether the proficiency exam you want to take is written or computer-based.

#### <a name="next" class="anchor"></a> Next Written Proficiency Exam Dates and Times

The Spring 2020 mid-semester written proficiency exam will be held **Tuesday
March 24th, 2020 from 7&ndash;10PM** in [DCL 1320](https://tinyurl.com/r5q8642).

<!---
As a reminder, the early-semester proficiency exam is restricted to
incoming freshman and other students who were not on campus the prior semester.
<!---
So if you were registered for courses at the University of Illinois in Spring
2019, you are not eligible to attend this proficiency exam seating.
<!---
If you think that you need an exemption from this policy, please email
[<code>proficiency&#8209;exams@lists.cs.illinois.edu</code>](mailto:proficiency-exams@lists.cs.illinois.edu).
<!---
Note that "I want an exemption" is not alone a valid reason for receiving an
exemption.
-->

Note that most proficiency exams are three hours in length.
<!--- -->
If you need extra time, please make arrangements to take the exam at
<!--- -->
[DRES](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/).

**You must arrive on time to take a proficiency exam.**
<!--- -->
If you arrive late you will not be seated.

### <a name="restrictions" class="anchor"></a> General Restrictions

In certain cases you may not be eligible to take a proficiency exam.
<!--- -->
You are responsible for understanding these conditions.
<!--- -->
**We will not attempt to determine whether you are eligible to take a
proficiency exam before you sit for it.**
<!--- -->
You will only find out later that you will not receive credit.
<!--- -->
So please review these restrictions carefully.

1. **You may not take a proficiency exam for a course that you have already
received a grade for.**
<!--- -->
This is true even if it was a failing grade.
<!--- -->
1. **You may only take each proficiency exam once in a 12-month period.**
<!--- -->
So, once you sit for a proficiency exam, you must wait a full year to retake the
same exam.
<!--- -->
If you sit for the same exam before the year is up, your score will not be
counted.
<!--- -->
This restriction applies both to written proficiency exams and to ones given in
the [CBTF](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/).
<!--- -->
1. **You may not take a proficiency exam if you have taken more than one later
course in the same area.**
<!--- -->
For example, you may not take the CS 173 Proficiency Exam if you have already
taken *both* CS 225 and CS 374, since they constitute two courses in the same area.
<!--- -->
Instead of taking the proficiency exam, you may be required to substitute other
later courses to fulfill your degree requirements.
<!--- -->
1. **Graduate students generally may only take Illinois Computer Science proficiency exams when
required to satisfy other degree programs.**
<!--- -->
Please contact the CS academic office to obtain permission if needed.

Other course-specific restrictions may also apply.
<!--- -->
Please consult the [information below specific to the proficiency exams you plan
to take](#courses) for more details.

### <a name="taking" class="anchor"></a> Taking Your Proficiency Exam

To take a written proficiency exam simply show up at one of the scheduled exam
times.
<!--- -->
To take a computer-based proficiency exam you must schedule a time with the
[CBTF](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/).
<!--- -->
You must bring your University of Illinois ID to the proficiency exam, if you
have one.
<!--- -->
**If you show up late or without proper identification, you will not be able to
sit for the exam.**

You may attempt multiple different proficiency exams during one written exam
sitting.
<!--- -->
However, each exam period finishes promptly at the times [indicated
above](#next), so you will need to work quickly to complete multiple exams in
the time allotted.

### <a name="results" class="anchor"></a> Receiving Your Results

If the exam is written, it may take several days before your exam is graded.
<!--- -->
You will receive your proficiency exam results directly from the instructor
supervising the exam.
<!--- -->
If the exam is given in the [CBTF](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/) you may receive your results
immediately.

### <a name="disabilities" class="anchor"></a> Information for Students with Disabilities

We will accommodate any disabilities that have been registered with the [Division
of Disability Resources and Educational Services
(DRES)](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/).
<!--- -->
Please use their [online
application](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/node/add/application-for-dres-services)
to notify them of your disability and register for support services.
<!--- -->
**If you are new to the University of Illinois you should begin this process as
soon as you are admitted.**

You should make arrangements to take your proficiency exam in the DRES testing
center by contacting
<!--- -->
[<code>proficiency&#8209;exams@lists.cs.illinois.edu</code>](mailto:proficiency-exams@lists.cs.illinois.edu).
<!--- -->
In your email be sure to indicate which proficiency exam (or exams) you wish to
take, and include a copy of your DRES letter documenting your accommodations.

### <a name="questions" class="anchor"></a> Questions or Concerns

If you have questions not covered here, or on the course-specific pages below,
please start a conversation on the [CS Advising Piazza
Forum](https://piazza.com/illinois/other/csadvising/home).
<!--- -->
That is the best way to have your questions answered quickly.
