<p class="lead" markdown="1">
<!--- -->
If you have already mastered the material covered in certain CS@Illinois
courses, you may receive credit and satisfy prerequisites by taking a
*proficiency exam*.
<!--- -->
Here you will find details about how to prepare and sign up for CS@Illinois
proficiency exams.
<!--- -->
</p>

## Overview

Proficiency exams are similar to a comprehensive final exam.
<!--- -->
They are intended to ensure that you are well-prepared for later courses in the
same subject area.
<!--- -->
Passing criteria are at the discretion of each course instructor.
<!--- -->
But in general an exam score that would correspond to a course grade of a B- is
considered a passing score.

### Scheduling

Written proficiency exams are generally offered at two times near the beginning of the
fall and spring semesters.
<!--- -->
Courses that give computer-based proficiency exams in the [Computer-Based
Testing Facility](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/) generally offer their exams
during a window of time near the beginning of the fall and spring semesters.
<!--- -->
Please consult the [course-specific information](#courses) below to determine
whether the proficiency exam you want to take is written or computer-based.

### General Restrictions

In certain cases you may not be eligible to take a proficiency exam.
<!--- -->
You are responsible for understanding these conditions.
<!--- -->
**We will not attempt to determine whether you are eligible to take a
proficiency exam before you sit for it.**
<!--- -->
You will only find out later that you will not receive credit.
<!--- -->
So please review these restrictions carefully.

1. **You may not take a proficiency exam for a course that you have already
received a grade for.**
<!--- -->
This is true even if it was a failing grade.
<!--- -->
1. **You may only take each proficiency exam once per year and no more two times
total.**
<!--- -->
If you sit for multiple exams within the same year only the first score
will be considered.
<!--- -->
1. **You may not take a proficiency exam if you have taken more than one later
course in the same area.**
<!--- -->
Instead of taking the proficiency exam, you may be required to substitute other
later courses to fulfill your degree requirements.
<!--- -->
1. **Graduate students generally may only take CS@Illinois proficiency exams when
required to satisfy other degree programs.**
<!--- -->
Please contact the CS academic office to obtain permission if needed.

### Taking Your Proficiency Exam

To take a written proficiency exam simply show up at one of the scheduled exam
times.
<!--- -->
To take a computer-based proficiency exam you must schedule a time with the
[Computer-Based Testing Facility](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/).
<!--- -->
You must bring your University of Illinois ID to the proficiency exam.
<!--- -->
**If you show up late or without proper identification, you will not be able to
sit for the exam.**

You may attempt multiple different proficiency exams during one written exam
sitting.
<!--- -->
However, each exam period finishes promptly at the times [indicated
above](#next), so you will need to work quickly to complete multiple exams in
the time allotted.

### Receiving Your Results

If the exam is written, it may take several days before your exam is graded.
<!--- -->
You will receive your proficiency exam results directly from the instructor
supervising the exam.
<!--- -->
If the exam is given in the [Computer-Based Testing
Facility](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/) you may receive your results
immediately.

### Information for Students with Disabilities

We will accommodate any disabilities that have been registered with the [Division
of Disability Resources and Educational Services
(DRES)](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/).
<!--- -->
Please use their [online
application](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/node/add/application-for-dres-services)
to notify them of your disability and register for support services.
<!--- -->
**If you are new to the University of Illinois you should begin this process as
soon as you are admitted.**

If you are entitled to up to 50% extra time to complete the exam but can
complete it in a typical testing environment, please just report at one or both
of the [usual dates and times](#next).
<!--- -->
If you need further accommodations or to take the proficiency exam in the DRES
testing center, please contact
