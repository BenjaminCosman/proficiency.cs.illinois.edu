### <a name="CS125" class="anchor"></a>[CS 125: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/)

* **Format**: computer-based
<!--- -->
* **Length**: 3 hours
<!--- -->
* **Location**: [CBTF](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/)
<!--- -->
* **Date and Time**: contact the [CBTF](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/) to
  schedule a time to take the CS 125 proficiency exam.
<!--- -->
  It will be available from Saturday 8/18/2018 through Saturday 9/1/2018.
<!--- -->
* **More Information**: is available on the [CS 125 website](https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/info/proficiency/).

Note that there are two versions of the CS 125 proficiency exam: one with
programming questions and code reading questions in Java, and a second with them
in C++.
<!--- -->
**If you are a CS major and want to continue to CS 126 you must take the
proficiency exam in Java.**
<!--- -->
CS 126 assumes that incoming students are familiar with Java, and students that
are not have struggled.
<!--- -->
If you are proficient in another programming language and strong enough to start
in CS 126, you should not have trouble learning enough Java to pass the
proficiency exam.

Other students may take the proficiency exam in either Java or C++ depending on
which language you are more familiar with.
<!--- -->
**However, you may still not take both in the same semester.**

Also note that ECE students *must* take
[ECE 220](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/profile/ECE220)
before taking CS 173 and CS 225.
<!--- -->
**ECE students may not take the CS 125 proficiency exam and then continue to CS
173.**
