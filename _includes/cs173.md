#### Additional information

Use [this link](https://www.prairielearn.org/pl/course_instance/129459) to join the exam on PrairieLearn.

You must be on the appropriate zoom session (see links above) the entire time that you are taking the exam.  

Use the conflict exam if you miss the main exam date for any reason.    Prior permission is not required.   However, it's better to take the exam early so that you can adjust your course schedule (if needed) as early as possible.

The student code does not allow you to take the CS 173 Proficiency Exam after taking either CS 225 or CS 374 (or later theoretical CS courses).

The website for the Spring 2021 offering of the course has a current set of skills lists, lecture notes, and videos.     Course websites for Spring 2019 and earlier have old hardcopy exams that you can use for practice.   (We have since moved the exams online.)
