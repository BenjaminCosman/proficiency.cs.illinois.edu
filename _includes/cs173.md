#### Additional information

Use [this link](https://www.prairielearn.org/pl/course_instance/129459) to join the exam on PrairieLearn.   When you click the link, you should see the course "CSPX 173".  (The exam itself may not be visible until closer to the exam date.)   There is no sign-up form to fill out.

You must be on the appropriate zoom session (see links above) the entire time that you are taking the exam.  If your zoom session dies during the exam, get back on as fast as possible and consult with the exam proctors.

Use the conflict exam if you miss the main exam date for any reason.    Prior permission is not required.   However, it is normally better to take the exam on the earlier date, so that you will get results earlier and have an easier time adjusting your course schedule if needed.

The student code does not allow you to take the CS 173 Proficiency Exam after taking CS 374 (or a more advanced theoretical CS course).

The website for the Spring 2021 offering of CS 173 has a current set of skills lists, lecture notes, and videos.     Course websites for Spring 2019 and earlier have old hardcopy exams that you can use for practice.   (We have since moved the exams online.)
