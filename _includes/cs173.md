#### Additional information

You must be on the appropriate zoom session (see links above) the entire time that you are taking the exam.   

Note that the student code does not allow you to take the CS 173 Proficiency Exam after taking either CS 225 or CS 374.

Sign-up information will be posted here closer to the exam.

The website for the Spring 2021 offering of the course has a current set of skills lists, lecture notes, and videos.     Course websites for Spring 2019 and earlier have old hardcopy exams that you can use for practice.   (We have since moved the exams online.)
